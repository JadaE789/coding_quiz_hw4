# coding_quiz_hw4

This weeks assignment required us to create a simple coding quiz using HtMl, CSS, and Javascript.
Per the instructions we had to meet some requirements within our quiz. When you open my quiz up in your browser and you press the 'begin quiz' button the timer starts running and the first questions appears. As you navigate through the questions if you get any of the answers incorrect time is reduced by 10 secs. When you finish with all the questions your score is displayed and you are able to type in your initials and save your score.
